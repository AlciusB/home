				<p>This webpage is going to be about webcomic ideas my younger sister and I come up with, the main one being <a href = "#Entomopedia">&ldquo;Entomopedia&rdquo;</a>(hence it being the name of the webpage).  The other two are called <a href = "#Zoo">&ldquo;Zoo&rdquo;</a> and <a href = "#Scholastic_Rumble">&ldquo;Scholastic Rumble&rdquo;</a>. The genre is supposed to be comedy, so I hope that I can convey it well! Below is a brief description of each:</p>
				<br>
				<h2 id = "Entomopedia">Entomopedia:</h2>
				<p>A girl named Bee tries to live a lazy life under the radar, but people keep on pulling her into their drama.</p>
				<h3>Characters:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><a href = "Bee.html">Bee (Rebecca) Viotto</a></li>
					<li>Ren Dumms</li>
					<li>Paris Bellington-Mort</li>
					<li>Blake Yang</li>
					<li>Clown n&lsquo; Stuff (Maurice, Deine, and Annabelle Guillaumes)</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 id = "Zoo">Zoo:</h2>
				<p>The daily life of Louie &#x1F43C;, Kaneko &#x1F640;, Coco &#x1F436; and Doggy &#x1F436; (he's Coco's twin.)</p>
			
				<h2 id = "Scholastic_Rumble">Scholastic Rumble:</h2>
				<p>Scholastic_Rumble is kind of an adaptation of some real-life experiences that are over exaggerated to make for a nice comedic effect. The main premise is that Jack has an enemy, named Senpai (a play on the typical &ldquo;lovable older student&rdquo; trope from manga), but said enemy actually has a crush on Jack (She doesn&lsquo;t like him back...).  Senpai slowly delves into questionable methods when trying to show his love for her (he also believes that Jack is a boy), which gets them into wacky hijinks.</p>
				<h3>Characters:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Jack</li>
					<li>Senpai</li>
				</ul>

				<p class = "Final Space" id = "last-line"><a href = "https://www.webtoons.com/en/">Webtoon</a> is my favorite place to read webcomics. My favorite webcomic is <a href = "https://www.webtoons.com/en/comedy/love-advice/list?title_no=1498">Love Advice from the Great Duke of Hell</a>, which is my inspiration because no matter how much I read it, it is always funny!</p></td>
