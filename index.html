			<p>This webpage is going to be about webcomic ideas my younger sister and I come up with, the main one being <a href = "#Entomopedia">&ldquo;Entomopedia&rdquo;</a>(hence it being the name of the webpage).  The other two are called <a href = "#Zoo">&ldquo;Zoo&rdquo;</a> and <a href = "#Scholastic_Rumble">&ldquo;Scholastic Rumble&rdquo;</a>. The genre is supposed to be comedy, so I hope that I can convey it well! Below is a brief description of each:</p>
			<h2 id = "Entomopedia">Entomopedia:</h2>
			<p>A girl named Bee tries to live a lazy life under the radar, but people keep on pulling her into their drama.</p> 
		
			<h3>Main Characters:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Bee (Rebecca) Viotto</li>
				<li>Ren Dumms</li>
				<li>Paris Belle-Mort</li>
				<li>Blake Yang</li>
				<li>Clown n&rsquo; Stuff (Maurice, Deine, and Annabelle Guillaumes)</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id = "Zoo">Zoo:</h2>
			<p>The daily life of Louie &#x1F43C;, Kaneko &#x1F640;, Coco &#x1F436; and Doggy &#x1F436; (he's Coco's twin.)</p>

			<p>Scholastic Rumble is kind of an adaptation of some real-life experiences that are over exaggerated to make for a nice comedic effect.  It is also the most recent addition to this collection of comics, so the characters are still in development. The main premise is that Jack has an enemy, named Senpai (a play on the typical &ldquo;lovable older student&rdquo; trope from manga), but said enemy actually has a crush on Jack (She doesn&lsquo;t like him back...).  Senpai slowly delves into questionable methods when trying to show his love for her (he also believes that Jack is a boy), which gets them into wacky hijinks.</p>
			<h3>Characters:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Jack</li>
				<li>Senpai</li>
			</ul>
			<p id = "last-line"><a href = "https://www.webtoons.com/en/">Webtoon</a> is my favorite place to read webcomics. My favorite webcomic is <a href = "https://www.webtoons.com/en/comedy/love-advice/list?title_no=1498">Love Advice from the Great Duke of Hell</a>, which is my inspiration because no matter how much I read it, it is always funny!</p>
