			<h2>Inspiration</h2>
			<p>There are many different things that inspire me because really, there is no such thing as original art, as every original idea is a product of other pre-existing ideas.</p>
			<h3> Pinterest </h3>
			<p>I have a couple <a href = "https://www.pinterest.ca/bribrialcius/art-ref/">pinterest boards</a> with art that inspires me.  I usually pin art from a game called &ldquo;Dislyte&rdquo;, because I love how the art for the game is lineless, but also so detailed!  This is something that is kind of hard to do with a lineless art style because it requires a lot of skills and knowledge in shape language, and anatomy.  I kind of aspire to have a style like this for my Entomopedia comic because the colorful nature and the shape language used gives the vibes of the chaotic-but-organized nature that this comic is supposed to have.  The style also gives a realistic sense (as humans are not actually outlined as portrayed in drawings with lineart), which goes well with the fact that Bee is just trying to live a normal life, and is a normal human being.  It also contrasts well with the fact that the majority of the cast is not human.</p>
			<h3>Dislyte Characters that Inspired Some of My Own Characters:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Xiao Yin - Azure Dragon (<a href = "Paris.html">Paris</a> Reference)</li>
				<li>Zelmer - Sekmet (<a href = "Bee.html">Bee</a> Reference)</li>
				<li>Kaylee - Anuket (<a href = "Ren.html">Ren</a> Reference)</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Fun Fact:</h3> 
			<p>These are two Dislyte characters (Zelmer and Xiao Yin respectively) are my favourite charaters design-wise, which is why I used them for my favourite characters (Bee and Paris).  Here's what they look like:</p>			<img class = "side-img" src = "Sekmetbee.jpg" alt = "An image of Zelmer (Sekmet) for Dislyte.">
			<img class = "side-img" src = "AzureDragon.jpg" alt = "An image of Xiao Yin (Azure Dragon) for Dislyte.">
