				<h2>Rebecca Viotto</h2>
				<p>Although there are multiple protagonists in this series, Rebecca Viotto, or Bee, is the cover girl.  After escaping a life planned out by her parents, Bee found an old cabin that is a lot more big on the inside than one might expect.  She was happy to find a quiet place where she could watch tv shows on her cardboard tv in peace, but that happiness was quickly shattered after she met her landlord, Blake Yang, a mysterious entity that will not let her stay in a cabin he does not own for free.  At least she'll be let alone at school, right? Wrong. After an unforeseen incident, the magical Student Council realized Bee is quite talented, and is way above the cockroach rank.  She particularly caught the Student Council President and Prince of the Land (what a number of achievements), <a href = "Paris.html">Paris Belle-Mort</a>&rsquo;s eye.  Even worse, <a href = "Ren.html">Ren Dumms</a>, the new girl in school with the most annoying personality even will not leave her be!</p>
