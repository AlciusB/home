      <p>This webpage is going to be about webcomic ideas my younger sister and I both come up with, the main one being "Entomopedia".  The other two are called "Zoo" and "Scholastic Rumble. The genre is supposed to be comedy, so I hope that I can convey it well! Below is a brief description of each:"</p>
      <br>
      <p>Entomopedia: A girl named Bee tries to live an lazy life under the radar, but people keep on pulling her into their drama.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Zoo: The daily life of Louie (a bear🐻), Kaneko (a cat🙀), Coco (a dog🐶) and Doggy (also a dog 🐶, he's Coco's twin.)</p>
      <br>
      <p>Scolastic Rumble is kind of an adaptation of some real-life experiences that are over exaggerated to make for nice comedic effect.  The main premise is that Jack has an enemy, named Senpai (a play on the typical "lovable older student" trope from manga), but said enemy actually has a crush on Jack (They don't like him back...).  Senpai slowly delves into questionable methods when trying to show his love for her (he also believes that Jack is a boy), which gets them into wacky hijinks.</p>
