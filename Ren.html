				<h2>Ren Dumms</h2>
				<p>Ren Dumms is a mystical being.  She may look like an ordinary girl, but she has a secret: She can swallow multiple people by merely inhaling. This ability is very useful when it comes to annoying people she doesn&rsquo;t want to deal with.  As the embodiment of all shojo manga protags, Ren often gets the favour of the background characters, so long as she&rsquo;s not around someone with a higher social ranking than her.  But even then, because she is a master-class manipulator, she is always able to flip things for her favour. Take <a href = "Paris.html">Paris</a>, the president of the school, who absolutely hates her. Why can&rsquo;t he stand her? Because she takes every moment possible to annoy him.  Another great example is <a href = "Bee.html">Bee</a> except Ren generally does want to be her friend and is not able to turn her annoying switch off.</p>
