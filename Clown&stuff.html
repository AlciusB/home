				<h2>Clown n&rsquo; Stuff</h2>
				<p>Clown n&rsquo; Stuff is a gang run by the 3 leaders, Deine, Maurice, and Annabelle Guillaumes.  Deine and Maurice are blood-related although their complexions might suggest otherwise.  Maurice is an albino, so many think that he and Deine are close friends when they are actually twins. Deine is the older of the two, and is the main leader of the gang, but Annabelle is the one that keeps them financially stable and able to go on.  They are good friends with <a href = "Bee.html">Bee</a>, because of their similar financial statuses, but they have mixed emotions about <a href = "Ren.html">Ren</a>.  Deine personally finds her interesting, and is one of the few people who can make Ren tick.  Maurice is the primary target of Ren&rsquo;s bullying because he easily lets his emotions get the better of him, he is aware that Ren takes advantage of him and is therefore appalled by her existence.  Annabelle is impartial to Ren, and believes that if she were to join Clown n&rsquo; Stuff she would make them a lot of money.</p>
