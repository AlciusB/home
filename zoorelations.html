			<h2> A &ldquo;Quick&rdquo; Briefing</h2>
			<p>As mentioned in the main page, this comic is about the daily life of 4 animal-humans. Most of these animal humans are based on stuffed animals my sister and I got when we were younger, with the exception of Kaneko. Some of the shenanigans they get into are based on our games back then. Underneath is a ”quick-quick“ briefing about each!:</p>		
			<h3>Coco (Chocolate Lemonade Marshmallow):</h3>
			<p>Now, you might be wondering, Briana, why did you give her such a long and random name? Coco is based on a stuffed animal with the same name, and that is what I named her. Coco has a confident personality, and happens to possess the powers of telepathy (two-way with her brother and one-way with others) and chocolate summoning. You could also say that she has super strength too, but all of that is her own muscle. Similar to a usual cat-dog relationship, Coco hates Kaneko because he's always up to no good and she believes that he is trying to steal Louie away from her brother.</p>
			<h3>Louie:</h3>
			<p>Louie is Coco&rsquo;s best friend.  According to my sister, &lsquo;Louie is blind to all forms of love.  Her mom calls her everyday saying &lsquo;When are you gonna get married?&rsquo; and Louie responds with a depressed &lsquo;sighhhhhhhhh....&rsquo;&rdquo;.  Little does she know that someone does like her, and sadly, she will never notice.</p>
			<h3>Doggy (Cory Lemonade Marshmallow):</h3>
			<p>Doggy is mute (Mainly because when we roleplayed, he was also the same stuffed dog as Coco, but I could not do a guy voice!), so he does not speak, but he is rumoured to have the voice of an angel(in both singing and talking).  His hobbies are going to the gym and playing video games with Kaneko, his best friend.  He also likes Louie but she will never notice...</p>
			<h3>Kaneko:</h3>
			<p>Kaneko is the most recent addition to the main characters, and did not have a stuffed cat, but I thought a cat would make a good rival for Coco.  He is a capable guy when he wants to be, and is able to make intelligent decisions that are often met with respect, but he never uses his skills for any good.  He often helps his friend Doggy by coming up with the plans to help him confess his love to Louie, but they always fail.</p>
